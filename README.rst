AWS ParallelCluster is an AWS supported Open Source cluster management tool that makes it easy for you to deploy and
manage High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters in the AWS cloud.
Built on the Open Source CfnCluster project, AWS ParallelCluster enables you to quickly build an HPC compute environment in AWS.
It automatically sets up the required compute resources and a shared filesystem and offers a variety of batch schedulers such as AWS Batch, SGE, Torque, and Slurm.
AWS ParallelCluster facilitates both quick start proof of concepts (POCs) and production deployments.
You can build higher level workflows, such as a Genomics portal that automates the entire DNA sequencing workflow, on top of AWS ParallelCluster.\

Quick Start
-----------
First, install the library:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install aws-parallelcluster

Next, configure your aws credentials and default region:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ aws configure
    AWS Access Key ID [None]: YOUR_KEY
    AWS Secret Access Key [None]: YOUR_SECRET
    Default region name [us-east-1]:
    Default output format [None]:

Then, run pcluster configure:

.. code-block:: ini

  $ pcluster configure
  Cluster Template [default]:
  Acceptable Values for AWS Region ID:
      ap-south-1
      ...
      us-west-2
  AWS Region ID [us-east-1]:
  VPC Name [myvpc]:
  Acceptable Values for Key Name:
    keypair1
    keypair-test
    production-key
  Key Name []:
  Acceptable Values for VPC ID:
    vpc-1kd24879
    vpc-blk4982d
  VPC ID []:
  Acceptable Values for Master Subnet ID:
    subnet-9k284a6f
    subnet-1k01g357
    subnet-b921nv04
  Master Subnet ID []:

Now you can create your first cluster;

.. code-block:: sh

  $ pcluster create myfirstcluster


After the cluster finishes creating, log in:

.. code-block:: sh

  $ pcluster ssh myfirstcluster

You can view the running compute hosts:

.. code-block:: sh

  $ qhost

Changes
-------

CfnCluster to AWS ParallelCluster
=================================
In Version `2.0.0`, we changed the name of CfnCluster to AWS ParallelCluster. With that name change we released several new features, which you can read about in the `Change Log`_.
