Autogenerated Templates
=======================

The following stack are generated with Troposphere:

- ``efs-substack.cfn.json``
- ``ebs-substack.cfn.json``
- ``fsx-substack.cfn.json``
- ``raid-substack.cfn.json``

To make changes and re-generate do:

```sh
cd cli/
python ../util/cfn-stacks-generators/generate-fsx-substack.py --target-path ../cloudformation/fsx-substack.cfn.json
tox -e cfn-format
# check for differences
git diff
```


JSON to YAML
============

The YAML CloudFormation template can be generated by converting the ``aws-parallelcluster.cfn.json`` file with the

**AWS CloudFormation Template Flip** tool. See https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cfn-template-flip
