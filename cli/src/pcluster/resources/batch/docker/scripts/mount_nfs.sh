This script mounts the shared dir from master instance on the nodes in the batch job.
The shared directory will be created if it does not exist.

USAGE:
mount_nfs <master_ip> <shared_dir>
master_ip: ip address of the main node
shared_dir: directory from master to be shared. If directory doesn't exist on compute, will be created
