# aws-parallelcluster-awsbatch-cli configuration file

# This is an optional file.
# 1. If the file doesn't exist, the CLI command will expect the --cluster parameter and
#    will ask the required information to the created Cluster.
# 2. If the file exists and the commands are executed without the --cluster parameter
#    the CLI will search for the cluster_name specified in the [main] section.
#    If the cluster section is not defined, the CLI will ask the required information to the created Cluster.
# 3. If the file exists and the commands are executed with the --cluster parameter
#    the CLI will use the parameters defined in the the [cluster <cluster-name>] section of this file.
#    If the section is not defined, the CLI will ask the required information to the created Cluster.

# This is the main section (required).
# It specifies the cluster to use when the commands are executed without the --cluster input parameter.

[cluster <cluster-name>]

# If not defined, the CLI will ask the required information to the created cluster.

# NOTE: the CLI will also search for the credentials in the [aws] section of the AWS ParallelCluster config file
# If not defined, boto3 will attempt to use environment or EC2 IAM role.
