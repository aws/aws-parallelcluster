AWS ParallelCluster is an AWS supported Open Source cluster management tool that makes it easy for you to deploy and
manage High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters in the AWS cloud.
Built on the Open Source CfnCluster project, AWS ParallelCluster enables you to quickly build an HPC compute environment in AWS.
It automatically sets up the required compute resources and a shared filesystem and offers a variety of batch schedulers such as AWS Batch, SGE, Torque, and Slurm.
AWS ParallelCluster facilitates both quick start proof of concepts (POCs) and production deployments.
You can build higher level workflows, such as a Genomics portal that automates the entire DNA sequencing workflow, on top of AWS ParallelCluster.

    usage: pcluster [-h]
                    {create,update,delete,start,stop,status,list,instances,ssh,configure,version,createami}
                    ...

    pcluster is a tool to launch and manage a cluster.

    positional arguments:
      {create,update,delete,start,stop,status,list,instances,ssh,configure,version,createami}
        create              creates a cluster
        update              update a running cluster
        delete              delete a cluster
        start               start the compute fleet that has been stopped
        stop                stop the compute fleet, but leave the master server running for debugging/development
        status              pull the current status of the cluster
        list                display a list of stacks associated with AWS ParallelCluster
        instances           display a list of all instances in a cluster
        ssh                 connect to the master server using SSH
        configure           creating initial AWS ParallelCluster configuration
        version             display version of AWS ParallelCluster
        createami           (Linux/OSX) create a custom AMI to use with AWS ParallelCluster

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    For command specific flags run pcluster [command] --help
