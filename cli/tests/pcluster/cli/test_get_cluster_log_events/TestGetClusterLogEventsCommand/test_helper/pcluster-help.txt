  --log-stream-name LOG_STREAM_NAME
                        Log stream name, as reported by 'pcluster list-
                        cluster-logs' command.
  --start-time START_TIME
                        Start time of interval of interest for log events, ISO
                        8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD (e.g.
                        1984-09-15T19:20:30+01:00), time elements might be
                        omitted.
  --end-time END_TIME   End time of interval of interest for log events, ISO
                        8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD (e.g.
                        1984-09-15T19:20:30+01:00), time elements might be
                        omitted.
  --head HEAD           Gets the first <head> lines of the log stream.
  --tail TAIL           Gets the last <tail> lines of the log stream.
  --next-token NEXT_TOKEN
                        Token for paginated requests.
  --stream              Gets the log stream and waits for additional output to
                        be produced. It can be used in conjunction with --tail
                        to start from the latest <tail> lines of the log
                        stream. It doesn't work for CloudFormation Stack
                        Events log stream.
  --stream-period STREAM_PERIOD
                        Sets the streaming period. Default is 5 seconds.
