  -i IMAGE_ID, --image-id IMAGE_ID
                        Export the logs related to the image id provided here.
  --bucket BUCKET       S3 bucket to export image builder logs data to. It
                        must be in the same region of the image. If not
                        specified, the ParallelCluster default bucket or the
                        CustomS3Bucket (if specified in the config) will be
                        used.
  --bucket-prefix BUCKET_PREFIX
