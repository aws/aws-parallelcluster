Retrieve the events associated with an image build.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i IMAGE_ID, --image-id IMAGE_ID
                        Id of the image.
  --log-stream-name LOG_STREAM_NAME
                        Name of the log stream.
  -r REGION, --region REGION
                        AWS Region that the operation corresponds to.
  --next-token NEXT_TOKEN
                        Token to use for paginated requests.
  --start-from-head START_FROM_HEAD
                        If the value is true, the earliest log events are
                        returned first. If the value is false, the latest log
                        events are returned first. (Defaults to 'false'.)
  --limit LIMIT         The maximum number of log events returned. If you
                        don't specify a value, the maximum is as many log
                        events as can fit in a response size of 1 MB, up to
                        10,000 log events.
  --start-time START_TIME
                        The start of the time range, expressed in ISO 8601
                        format (e.g. '2021-01-01T20:00:00Z'). Events with a
                        timestamp equal to this time or later than this time
                        are included.
  --end-time END_TIME   The end of the time range, expressed in ISO 8601
                        format (e.g. '2021-01-01T20:00:00Z'). Events with a
                        timestamp equal to or later than this time are not
                        included.
  --debug               Turn on debug logging.
  --query QUERY         JMESPath query to perform on output.
