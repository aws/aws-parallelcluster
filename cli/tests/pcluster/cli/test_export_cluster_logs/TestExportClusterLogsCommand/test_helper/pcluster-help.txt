  --output OUTPUT       File path to save log archive to.
  --bucket BUCKET       S3 bucket to export cluster logs data to. It must be
                        in the same region of the cluster
  --bucket-prefix BUCKET_PREFIX
                        Keypath under which exported logs data will be stored
                        in s3 bucket. Also serves as top-level directory in
