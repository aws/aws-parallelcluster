pcluster is the AWS ParallelCluster CLI and permits launching and management
of HPC clusters in the AWS cloud.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

                        region.
    delete-cluster      Initiate the deletion of a cluster.
    describe-cluster    Get detailed information about an existing cluster.
    update-cluster      update-cluster command help
    describe-compute-fleet-status
                        Describe the status of the compute fleet
    update-compute-fleet-status
                        Update the status of the cluster compute fleet.

                        Describe the instances belonging to a given cluster.
    list-images         Retrieve the list of existing custom images managed by
                        the API. Deleted images are not showed by default
    build-image         Create a custom ParallelCluster image in a given
                        region.
    delete-image        Initiate the deletion of the custom ParallelCluster
                        image.
    describe-image      Get detailed information about an existing image.
    describe-official-images
                        Describe ParallelCluster AMIs.
    status              Displays the current status of the cluster.
    configure           Start the AWS ParallelCluster configuration.

    export-cluster-logs
                        Export the logs of the cluster to a local tar.gz
                        archive by passing through an Amazon S3 Bucket.
    get-cluster-log-events
                        Retrieve the events of a log stream of the cluster.
    instances           Displays a list of all instances in a cluster.
    list-cluster-logs   List the log streams associated to a cluster.
    list-clusters       Retrieves the list of existing AWS ParallelCluster
                        clusters.
    list                Displays a list of stacks created by AWS

                        stopped.
    stop                Stops the compute fleet, leaving the head node
                        running.
    update              Updates a running cluster using the values in the
                        config file.
    build-image         Creates a custom AMI to use with AWS ParallelCluster.
