Here you can find guides for getting started with the development of AWS ParallelCluster.

.. warning::
    The following guides are instructions for building a custom AMI, use a custom version of the cookbook recipes or a custom AWS ParallelCluster Node package.
    These are advanced method of customizing AWS ParallelCluster, with many hard to debug pitfalls.
    The AWS ParallelCluster team highly recommends using :doc:`pre_post_install` scripts for customization, as post install hooks are generally easier to debug and more portable across releases of AWS ParallelCluster.
