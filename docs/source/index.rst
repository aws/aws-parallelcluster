CfnCluster
##########

CfnCluster ("cloud formation cluster") is a framework that deploys and maintains high performance computing clusters on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Developed by AWS, CfnCluster facilitates both quick start proof of concepts (POCs) and production deployments. CfnCluster supports many different types of clustered applications and can easily be extended to support different frameworks. Download CfnCluster today to see how CfnCluster's command line interface leverages AWS CloudFormation templates and other AWS cloud services.
