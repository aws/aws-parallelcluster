Configuration
=============
.. toctree::

ParallelCluster uses the file ``~/.parallelcluster/config`` by default for all configuration parameters.

An example configuration file can be found at ``site-packages/aws-parallelcluster/examples/config``.


Layout
------

Configuration is defined in multiple sections.

Required sections are "global" and "aws".

At least one "cluster" and one "subnet" section must be included.

A section starts with the section name in brackets, followed by parameters and configuration. ::

    cluster_template = default
    update_check = true
    sanity_check = true

Defines the Performance Mode of the file system.

Valid choices are generalPurpose or maxIO (these are case-sensitive).

We recommend generalPurpose performance mode for most file systems.

File systems using the maxIO performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate

efs_fs_id

Specifying this option will void all other EFS options except for shared_dir.

config_sanity will only support file systems without a mount target in the stack's
availability zone *or* file systems that have an existing mount target in the stack's
availability zone with inbound and outbound NFS traffic allowed from 0.0.0.0/0.

The sanity check for validating efs_fs_id requires the IAM role to have the following permissions:

efs:DescribeMountTargets
efs:DescribeMountTargetSecurityGroups
ec2:DescribeSubnets
ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups

Please add these permissions to your IAM role or set `sanity_check = false` to avoid errors.

CAUTION: Having mount target with inbound and outbound NFS traffic allowed from 0.0.0.0/0
will expose the file system to NFS mounting request from anywhere in the mount target's
availability zone.  AWS recommends *not* creating a mount target in the stack's availability
zone and letting us handle this step.  If you must have a mount target in the stack's
availability zone, please consider using a custom security group by providing a vpc_security_group_id
option under the vpc section, adding that security group to the mount target, and turning
off config sanity to create the cluster.

Do not use NONE or /NONE as the shared directory.::

    shared_dir = /fsx

fsx_fs_id
"""""""""
**Optional** Attach an existing FSx File System.

If this option is specified, all following FSx parameters, such as ``storage_capacity`` are ignored. ::

    fsx_fs_id = fs-073c3803dca3e28a6

storage_capacity
""""""""""""""""
**Optional** The storage capacity of the file system in GiB.

The storage capacity has a minimum of 3,600 GiB and is provisioned in increments of 3,600 GiB.

Defaults to 3,600 GiB. ::

    storage_capacity = 3600

import_path
"""""""""""
**Optional** S3 Bucket to load data from into the file system. Also serves as the export bucket. See ``export_path``.

Import occurs on cluster creation, see `Importing Data from your Amazon S3 Bucket
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/fsx-data-repositories.html#import-data-repository>`_

If not provided, file system will be empty. ::

    import_path =  s3://bucket

imported_file_chunk_size
""""""""""""""""""""""""
**Optional** For files imported from a data repository (using ``import_path``), this value determines the stripe count
and maximum amount of data per file (in MiB) stored on a single physical disk. The maximum number of disks that a single
file can be striped across is limited by the total number of disks that make up the file system.

The chunk size default is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB).
Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

Valid only when using ``import_path``. ::

    imported_file_chunk_size = 1024

export_path
"""""""""""
**Optional** The S3 path where the root of your file system is exported. The path **must** be in the same S3 bucket as
the ``import_path`` parameter.

Defaults to ``s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre[creation-timestamp]`` where ``import-bucket`` is the bucket provided in
``import_path`` parameter.

Valid only when using ``import_path``. ::

    export_path = s3://bucket/folder

weekly_maintenance_start_time
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
***Optional** Preferred time to perform weekly maintenance, in UTC time zone.

Format is [day of week]:[hour of day]:[minute of hour]. For example, Monday at Midnight is: ::

    weekly_maintenance_start_time = 1:00:00
