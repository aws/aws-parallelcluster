This document provides guidance for getting started with AWS ParallelCluster development.

.. warning::
    The following guidelines provide instructions for using custom versions of the cookbook recipes
    or a custom AWS ParallelCluster Node package.
    These are advanced method of customizing AWS ParallelCluster with many hard-to-debug pitfalls.
    The AWS ParallelCluster team strongly recommends using :doc:`pre_post_install` scripts for customization, as post
    install hooks are generally easier to debug and port across releases of AWS ParallelCluster.
