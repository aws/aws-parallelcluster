    This is a detailed description of the AWS ParallelCluster service.


AWS ParallelCluster is an AWS-supported Open Source cluster management tool that makes it easy to deploy and
manage High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters in the AWS cloud.

AWS ParallelCluster supports the following features:

- Multiple Linux flavors including Amazon Linux, CentOS, and Ubuntu.
- Configurable autoscaling of compute resources.
- Custom AMIs.
- Shared file systems built from EBS, EFS, and FSxL (Lustre) volumes.
- EBS RAID functionality.
- Private subnet deployments.
- Multiple HPC schedulers including AWS Batch, Grid Engine, Torque, and Slurm.

AWS ParallelCluster facilitates both quick start proof-of-concepts (POCs) and massive production deployments.
It can be used to orchestrate higher level workflow use cases such as automated DNA sequencing pipelines,
global weather forecasting, cryptography, fluid dynamics simulations, jet engine design, credit card fraud
detection, insurance risk modeling, and protein-ligand docking analysis.
