## Maintainers

This cookbook is maintained by the Sous Chefs. The Sous Chefs are a community of Chef cookbook maintainers working together to maintain important cookbooks. If youâ€™d like to know more please visit [sous-chefs.org](https://sous-chefs.org/) or come chat with us on the Chef Community Slack in [#sous-chefs](https://chefcommunity.slack.com/messages/C2V7B88SF).

## Motivation

Quite often, the need arises to do line editing instead of managing an entire file with a template resource. This cookbook supplies various resources that will help you do this.

## Limitations

- The line resources processes the entire target file in memory. Trying to edit large files may fail.
- The end of line processing was only tested using `\n` and `\r\n`. Using other line endings very well may not work.
- The end of line string used needs to match the actual end of line used in the file `\n` and `\r\n` are used as the defaults but if they don't match the actual end of line used in the file the results will be weird.
- Adding a line implies there is a separator on the previous line. Adding a line differs from appending characters.
- Lines to be added should not contain EOL characters. The providers do not do multiline regex checks.
- Missing file processing is the way it is by intention

  - `add_to_list` do nothing, list not found so there is nothing to add to.
  - `append_if_no_line` create file, add the line.
  - `delete_from_list` do nothing, the list was not found which implies there is nothing to delete
  - `delete_lines` do nothing, the line isn't there which implies there is nothing to delete
  - `replace_or_add` create file, add the line
  - `filter_lines` create file if the file changes

- Chef client version 13 or greater is expected.

## Resources

For more detailed information see the matching resource documentation:

- [append_if_no_line](https://github.com/sous-chefs/line/blob/master/documentation/resources/append_if_no_line.md) - Add a missing line
- [replace_or_add](https://github.com/sous-chefs/line/blob/master/documentation/resources/replace_or_add.md) - Replace a line that matches a pattern or add a missing line
- [delete_lines](https://github.com/sous-chefs/line/blob/master/documentation/resources/delete_lines.md) - Delete lines that match a pattern
- [add_to_list](https://github.com/sous-chefs/line/blob/master/documentation/resources/add_to_list.md) - Add an item to a list
- [delete_from_list](https://github.com/sous-chefs/line/blob/master/documentation/resources/delete_from_list.md) - Delete an item from a list
- [filter_lines](https://github.com/sous-chefs/line/blob/master/documentation/resources/filter_lines.md) - Supply a ruby proc or use a sample filter to edit lines.
